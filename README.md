# moleculer-db-adapter-typeorm [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/moleculer-db-adapter-sequelize.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moleculer-db-adapter-typeorm)

SQL adapter (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite & MSSQL, Oracle and many more) for Moleculer DB service with [typeorm](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).

it is essentially a clone of the great work on adaptor for [Sequelize](https://github.com/moleculerjs/moleculer-db/tree/master/packages/moleculer-db-adapter-sequelize) by the auther of the project - since i have a need to use oracle - and i prefer typescript i just created a replice of the project.

```javascript 1.8
service.adapter.repository;
```
